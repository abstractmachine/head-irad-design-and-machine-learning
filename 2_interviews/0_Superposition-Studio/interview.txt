Transcript:

**Alexia:** Hi, Robin, Casper. Thank you so much for your time this morning. You are from a superposition studio. Let's start with if you could tell me a little bit more about the interest of your studio, the size of your studio, the type of projects you do usually. 

**Superposition studio:** Thanks for for having us today, Alexia. We are Capser and Bhram from Superposition studio .We are a studio with three persons. The third person is Robin. We are a studio who focuses on using new technologies to tell stories. That's our main interest, which is a very general and broad interest. We like to work with these technologies, new, custom program tools for example, or machine learning or media like projections or sensors. We always apply them in a very human way So we, we make things that are very high tech but we don't want people to feel like they are high-tech. We want people to experience a sort of human, emotive or even expressive connection with the stories that we tell. And only on the secondary level, do they suddenly realize that what they are looking at is actually technology. I think that's sort of describes our interests as a studio in a nutshell.

**Alexia:** You mentioned that you create custom program or you're using machine learning. Do you have any example of a project where you had to use machine learning? Did you, you create a custom program for that? Or did you use like a tool that was already available? 

**Superposition studio:** I think if I can split that into two questions, the first is sort of the custom tool side, which especially for our more graphic work, is particularly interesting. I think, which started for us with creating, well actually just programming tools. So most of the things we make is programmed and has some sort of coding behind it. And what we like about creating custom tools is that you are not bound to what someone else has built. So if you, if you only use illustrator or Photoshop or you know, any of these tools, even After Effects or even Blender, then you are always constricted a little bit. You can find more complexity, but then also more interesting boundaries, basically, if you define your own tools. So that's why we, we are interested particularly in creating our own things and then machine learning that's a particularly interesting field to explore because there's so much complexity already there. There are so many tools available, but none of them are easy to use or, quick to, get the results with, which makes it particularly interesting for us as programmers as well to work with. and also surprising in a sense, 

**Alexia:** Could you tell me more some of the tools using machine learning that are not necessarily easy to use. Is it because they're hard to access? Is it because you need to have programming knowledge to use them, or is it because they really restrictive at the moment? Like what makes them not easy to use in your opinion? 

**Superposition studio:** I think it's a combination of all these things. There's a couple of tools readily available for everyone to use. They also have, a GUI graphic user interface and they allow you to interact on a very basic level with quite powerful machine learning models. So this is definitely an interesting, entrance into working with machine learning and actually because it's machine learning and it's therefore unpredictable, there will always be people who do brilliant stuff with very simple tools. That's, that's similar to when using Photoshop or illustrator, you can always find a way to use it in a way that's maybe not the way it was designed for or in any other way, you just basically make it work for you. And then of course, there's the more scientific side to machine learning, which is a whole different game than creative programming as as many of us graphic designers who are interested in working with code are used to, it's basically scripting, right? It's setting the computer, what you want it to do. I think with machine learning it, if you really want to have control over the exact parameters and functioning of your algorithm of your model a lot of mathematical knowledge is needed all of a sudden and a lot of statistical knowledge that is far from your average high school level, which is mostly enough for scripting, but it's definitely not enough for writing machine learning models. And which makes me also particularly interested in how this is going to evolve, in terms of, well, for example if you let's take Photoshop as an example you have to use these filters rights that like even something as simple as a gaussian blur or something, the maths behind it is actually, it's still understandable at some level, but it's not, you know, high school math what's going on there. But by choosing the parameters that you can tweak for that gaussian blur filter, it becomes quite intuitive, right. You just have this slider and it sort of tells you how blurry the image will be. And I think the same might not at the moment, but might also find its way into machine learning. I think it's also an interface problem. How do we interface with machine learning algorithms? And if we find sort of a translation from a purely mathematical parameters into something more human parameters, like maybe something like complexity and it just changes the visual complexity of your house these more aesthetic and more human parameters. It might be also easier to start working with it. And then from there continue to develop your own machine learning algorithms.

**Alexia:** Can you think of any, tools that are, successful at the moment in your opininon? I mean, I totally understand that you have the ones , let's say like for Runway even teachable machines or tools like that are accessible to designers and they can play with them and you have the more scientific side as you mentioned, but is there any tools that you already use in your process that you found were really interesting or you managed to have a great outcome out of them. Or did you only stay with custom solutions? 

**Superposition studio:** I worked a lot with teachable machine and runway ML I think a lot of online tools are also interesting, like art reader, and a couple more they keep popping up continuously of course, there's the GP T3 playground, which is now open. So you can, you can use like the most. advanced text generator, which even generates code almost for free. Our most used, machine learning tool is actually the copilot that writes your code with you. But, but that's a side track. Maybe I also want to add a Wekinator later to that list we sometimes use it at the start of our process as well. that's like the lowest entry, you can, you can get into this world and you can actually use it, even more simply than processing. So it's great little tool that does very basic machine learning, but it's still machine learning. It's not, you're telling a machine basically what steps it needs to take. It's just you telling the machine. Well, here's a bunch of examples. Classify this we did a project where we tried to classify generative, letter forms and it, so it just generates a form. and then it generates a forms and tries to make a font out of it what it recognizes as letters. And we just use Wekinator her for, for that, with the pixel map. So, so I think there's, there's sort of a variety of things available in a variety of complexities all the way up to, you know, using something like TensorFlow with five-ten for creating your own implementations. I would like to add to that because we didn't mention it yet because we were talking about tools what we also do a lot is use. Ready-mades Jupiter notebooks on Google CoLab. and the nice thing about it is that you're actually, you're running machine learning. Like you're running the code, you have access to everything. But since they're completely set up for you, you can just, open up a notebook, run it, see what it does, and maybe tweak some parameters . Change the inputs , and see what happens. For me that's the closest you can get to at the moment doing creative coding with machine learning, it's basically opening up, a model in, in Colab and just start fiddling with it.

**Alexia:** Yeah. We had some experience with Colab our students and it was quite successful. I thought they did manage it pretty well. Did you have an example of a project where you use one of those tools that it's already published, or is it more that you use it to generate ideas? At which state do you usually use machine learning tools in your creative process?

**Superposition studio:** The project that I would like to mention that is most, literal machine learning outcome is called Deep Family and it's a collaboration with a painter, with an artist. She was interested in if she could change her idea of her family history by basically reshaping her family photo album. She had like a couple of thousand pictures from her family history and we basically trained a GAN model, an image generating machine learning model on all those images. And we try to have the model recreate memories for her. So snapshots portraits of an existing family members. We thought that this was a really nice conceptual perspective on the way AI also works. Tries to make sense of data that comes from the physical world that of course it cannot relate to. And that was a real literal machine learning project, of course. So the outcome is also pretty much recognizable as generated images that are then translated into paintings by the artist.

**Alexia:** And do you have examples of other projects where, machine learning was not the end goal of the project , like you mentionedwith the Adobe sensei, filters or even, like the use of Wekinator. Sometimes machine learning does not have to be the goal .Do you have other examples 

**Superposition studio:** I maybe to stick with the Wekinator, because it's more of a tool in your entire process of creating something. So, we have an installation, for example, that uses people tracking. So it's just tracking people around the room. It's quite an old project already of ours. But then sometimes we update that also a little bit to use different sensors a different whatever. And here you can, also start tracking people and launching events, basically in your installation by using machine learning . First you have to sort of maybe tell a computer. Well if a person crosses this particular threshold and their arms are raised, for example. Then I want this to happen that would be the way you would do it before. But what you can do now is just do something in the space, just have your installation running, do something in space and just record a bunch of movements and things going on. And it will figure out what to do when a particular action is taken by a user. I think that's quite an easy tool that also plays just one small part in the entire process. But there machine learning is just one piece of the puzzle basically. And it also fits a little bit into what I said before about the end result and not being sort of high tech or feeling like. Wow, this is you know, this is the future, or this is overwhelming or whatever. Now this is a very, just intuitive human experience that I'm having here. So you are thinking about machine learning at all while you are standing there. But the results can be quite a bit better than it was when you were programming it to yourself when you were because there is a particular boundary that you have to cross. For example, you always feel the installation behaves a little bit weird, where it can run your around that border and all of that sort of smooth that out a little bit. It's also when you're using these types of machine learning 

**Alexia:** and is there like know I need types of machine learning application could be in the field of graphic design or in the field design in general that you think are underused today or not explored enough. And maybe there's something you'd really be curious to try.

**Superposition studio:** I would be super interested in using the kind of systems that for instance drive really high-profile. purposes today, like self-driving cars, for instance or there's a lot of a lot of science going into these prediction systems, like to predict the weather or the stock market. If that kind of tools would be also accessible to creatives. I think that will be really interesting because these tools are typically used for real-world problems. I think one of the interesting things about creatives and designers is that they basically applied these methods to do things that they weren't designed for or developed for. I think that's where you see. You start to see things that you cannot predict. And I think that's where it gets interesting. 

**Alexia:** The prediction system will be an interesting way of seeing how that could could be apply to design . I think that another question I wanted to, you mentioned it a little bit earlier. Right now graphic designers, they use actually machine learning in their everyday practice, but maybe they don't really necessarily realize it. What do you think would be Needed for graphic designers to access more machine learning tools, or like, do you think of any competencies they will need to achieve or is it more on the interface design that needs to make it easier for them to use those machine learning tools?

**Superposition studio:** That's a good question. I work with students and with machine learning and we're basically trying to explore to use machines as a creative partner basically and sometimes I don't have the feeling that they need different tools, but they need a different way of thinking because. As designers we're so used to use the computer in a predictable way. Like if I do this you know, if I, if I move this slider, I know that my image will get blurrier for instance, and with machine learning, it's not like that at all. So I think it's basically introduces a whole new paradigm to do designing namely. That you're basically trying to set you're setting rules, you're setting boundaries. And you see what what the system comes up with within those rules. And I think for a lot of us, that's still problematic because we want to control. Or we have a certain image in our mind, which is not going to give us. Yeah. It's also has to do with the traditional graphic design. I didn't study graphic design, I studied interactive design. So you already come at it from a, from a slightly different perspective, but I, when I speak to students who are more graphic design oriented, or even just studied graphic design There's a very rich tradition of knowing the rules and then breaking them. So a good example, I always feel like it's margins. So whenever we make something, we have our graphic designer , Robyn, you know, he always says, well, if you use a multiple three, for example, like Karel Martens or all these, very traditional graphic designers that are very good at these rules and then applying them in, in interesting ways. I think that's the traditional graphic design and you'll see now that more and more that's even though it fits very well with computers rules, right. . But you need to have like Casper said, a different mindset so your entire subjects changing anyway. So I don't think machine learning doesn't have to be like a roadblock or something that is particularly hard , to come up with, but it does require a different mindset and I'm not saying that graphic design is just follow the rules, right. It's it's not like it's just multiples of three and then everything is beautiful, but you, you have to know the rule and then break it.

And that's where the creative process takes place. And I don't think that is that much different than this. In this case, so yeah, quite an exciting rope or boundary that you are that this discipline is, is sort of crossing over now. 

**Alexia:** That that's definitely an interesting point about them, the mindset, because, well, one of the competencies designers will need to have now is learning how to create your own data set, right? That's already a big curatorial decisions that you make, which test they going to do and how you going to mix it maybe with another data set. And I think that's also going to be really exciting on how, how to teach students how to do that, but also how can practitioners learn to create this data set? Do you think that's something that could be taught or is it more that we should be relying on collaboration with engineers? For example, maybe, maybe you have an experience to share with creating your own data set that could be that you could share right now, like something interesting that happened in your creative process.

Sorry. There was like a lot of questions. 

**Superposition studio:** Well, I I'll try to extract something from there, but I think that's a very important point that you're making. And an example that I would like to give is not on our end. At least it's not very much related to machine learning, but it is a good example. It's a very recent project we did. We did with amnesty international. It's basically a data set of all the surveillance cameras in New York city public surveillance cameras. So cameras, that are employed by the New York city police department. A big part of them has capabilities of facial recognition. So it uses facial recognition to track people in the industries and amnesty international has obviously an opinion about the human rights aspects of, that practice. And there, we wanted to tell that story.

We always like to tell stories that don't necessarily sort of impose a particular point of view, right? So we like to give people sort of honest representation and then let them form their own view on that data. So our job in that case was not so much to create our own data. Or to, come up with a way to convince people of our our story. But to, listen very closely to what amnesty was doing with their collection of the data, because, well, it goes a little bit too far, maybe, but they also employed people to collect that data and then put bunches of data engineers on it also to or data analysts to make sure it's all sound. And I think that is an entirely different discipline that we, that you don't want to be in. Also when you are a designer it's not your job to engineer or analyze It's not your job to come up with the story. It's your job to tell it.

Right. So in that case, our job was to, to receive from them, all of these datasets, because there was a lot more than just the cameras for school police actions around these cameras, for example, and then extract from. What things are interesting, what things are important to tell and how do we show it? How do we so all of this, maybe your question was five questions, one, and maybe this is also a five answers in one, but I don't think you want to be always in the role of all of these different disciplines. You don't want to be an engineer and a data analyst and no, your, your, your job is quite well-defined. It's a designer or a storyteller or so don't step into the pitfall of trying to become all of these different highly advanced roles. 

**Alexia:** I think that's it. That's a good point. But then then we almost, at the end of the interview with, to extract those data, did you use. Specific tools or like, how did you go about like finding the right the data to tell the story you wanted to tell?

**Superposition studio:** Well, the most important tool is your ears. I think listening to the people who know what they are talking about And what is important about the story. And then when you when you, when you get the data the tools that you use to, to, to analyze are for us, they are also the tools to visualize. So what we usually do is we create a bunch of visualizations of the, of the data And these can be you know, in this case, like I said, it's not so much machine learning related, but I think it applies directly also to machine learning projects. If you want to get a feel for the, for the data and our way as designers is to visualize or to, to make qualitative or to make visual in another sense the tools you want to use are your ears and your eyes basically. And then technically you can use whatever you can use, you know, processing or, runway ML, whatever is needed at that point. 

**Alexia:** And then I have one last question, which we ask everyone. Does machine learning frighten you in any way, you know, this idea of automation entering the world of design.

And can you think of any strategies that we need to employ to co-create with those machines? It could be a day, you know, frightened at all. You know, it's funny because most of the graphic designers I asked there , didn't really have an opinion about it, but I feel like the people who are used to working with machine learning and not frightened by it at all, because I think that it's totally demystify for them. But for people who are not in the field, sometime it can feel a bit frightening. 

**Superposition studio:** I'm mostly frightened by the trust that people will put in to the conclusions of machines because they can be used for very dangerous purposes. And in the end we trained them. So, I mean, it's almost a cliche, but we are basically educating these machines and they will have our biases and our preconceptions and I think that's dangerous if we say like, oh, this machine tells that that this and this person is dangerous.

So it must be true. No, I mean, the machine doesn't even know what a person is. The machine just processes, a lot of statistical data. Doesn't know anyone, anything about this individual. And I think this is something I'm worried. Also Alexia. I would like to comment on your previous question about the datasets, because I think. Is completely right that, you know, you don't need to do everything. You don't want to do everything. And especially data sciences and data analysis. This is a complete different profession, but I also think it's really interesting to browse existing data sets and just see what you can do with those. I would like to describe one example of a student who found this dataset of microscopic. micro imagery. It's on a website. It's a photography award given to micro photography by Nicole and it contains thousands of micro images. And he just downloaded all these images and he had this data set of beautiful images and he then created a three-dimensional world which was completely built out of the textures from from these images. And then basically by training a GAN on these images. So, he had an infinite amount of microscopic structures and you had them grow into this world and you could just be in this completely other worldly environment and he synthesized sounds from these images. It was beautiful. And it was obviously not something that this data set or this collection of images was ever made for, but it was it was a beautiful example of how to work with existing data sets in novel ways. 

**Alexia:** Yeah, definitely. The idea of. Came up a lot throughout the different interviews with that. That's that's I think it's a, it's a great point. Okay. I think we reached the end of the interview. Is there anything you would like to, to add or always it's all good on your side. 

**Superposition studio:** I would like to know if Bhram is afraid of a machine learning. You described perfectly Casper I, I agree completely, but I also think we went through these these cycles many times before.

So photography, for example when this came up was the same story. So I am, I wouldn't describe it as afraid because I think we, are capable of traversing these quagmires often do with technologies So I'm not so much afraid to, but we should be wary and we should be you know, it's, it's, it's a little bit uncharted territory still, and that's always dangerous. So you know, wear a safety helmet, I would say also it can potentially be, become a very, very powerful technology. Obviously we're talking about, you know, a couple of decades from now It will be, maybe it will be different conversation. That's something I still keep in mind. I think maybe I'm an optimist in the, in depth, in that sense for now. And then we'll see, we'll see again in a few years, maybe 

**Alexia:** Well, thank you very much.
