Input:
I think it’s also an interface problem. How do we interface with machine learning algorithms? And if we find sort of a translation from a purely mathematical parameters into something more human parameters, like maybe something like complexity and it just changes the visual complexity of your house these more aesthetic and more human parameters.

Output:
Then we can make a more effective interface with the machine learning algorithm, rather than having to deal with data that you can’t quite interpret. I think about this problem quite a lot, and I think that the most effective way to interface with machine learning algorithms is to come up with an intuitive and visual way of looking at the data. A lot of the data sets that machine learning algorithms typically use are very large, and can be difficult to understand in isolation. A visual representation of the data can help to make it easier to understand and interpret, allowing people to identify patterns and trends in a way that would otherwise be impossible. Additionally, if you can create a visual representation of the data set that reflects the complexity of the data, it can help to make machine learning algorithms more interpretable and easier to use.
