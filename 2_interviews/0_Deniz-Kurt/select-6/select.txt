Input:
It doesn’t have to be that if we have a machine learning arts, our art is eerily. No, it’s just like, it creates just different sub branches underneath each other. And then I think different sub-genres maybe different opinions and also really makes us think about our co-creation.

Output:
It's possible to use machine-learning to create art of various types and styles. AI can be used to generate original artwork and generate new and distinct concepts. The possibilities of machine learning in art are exciting, as it opens up a new way for humans to create together and explore different concepts and ideas. AI-generated works are unique and can help us appreciate and explore how art can evolve and adapt to new ideas. A combination of human-created and machine-generated art can create a powerful dialogue between the two and spark curiosity and further discovery.
