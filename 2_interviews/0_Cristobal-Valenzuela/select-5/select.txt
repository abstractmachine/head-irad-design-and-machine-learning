Erin and Jody discuss machine learning as a tool, a new source in the creative toolkit, and an area of new skills to stand out in, regardless of your profession. Jody So the overall message I’m hearing from you is that we all need to be thinking about how to use machine learning and our work because it’s not going away? Erin Exactly it’s not going away. And it’s for everyone, whether it’s software engineers or people in the arts that also need to get in there and start to understand it. So it’s not like this is an additional job description. It’s not just for Google or Amazon. It’s for everyone. And the more people that understand and can use machine learning, the better.
