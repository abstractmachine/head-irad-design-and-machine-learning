Whether it's a painting, drawing or a sculpture, there is something special about creating an object that displays a sense of thought and creativity. The ability to come up with a unique solution or concept which evokes emotion or inspires you is so rewarding. I suppose in a way it's like my own little artistic puzzle. When I'm creating something that touches something in the viewer's imagination it's like I've accomplished something bigger than myself and it's incredibly satisfying.
