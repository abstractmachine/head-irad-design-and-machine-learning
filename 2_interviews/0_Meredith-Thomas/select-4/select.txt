with more and more options. And as I’ve been able to practice, experiment, and explore more and more I’ve been finding that there are other pieces of hardware out there that are increasingly important. For example, a MIDI controller, or an interface, or a particular type of software. So these types of investments have become increasingly important as my personal interest in music technology and production has kept on growing. But at the end of the day, I believe, that if you want to be successful in this area, then you need to invest in yourself first and foremost. That means spending the time to learn, practice, research, and experiment as much as you can to learn what works best for you.
